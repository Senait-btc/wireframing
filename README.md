What Is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual blueprint of a user interface. It outlines the basic structure, layout, and navigation of a digital product—such as a website or mobile app—without focusing on design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes are typically created using tools like Draw.io, Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD.

Why Wireframing Is Important in the Design Process
🧠 Clarifies Ideas Wireframes help designers and stakeholders visualize the layout and functionality before development begins.

📣 Enhances Communication They serve as a common language between designers, developers, and clients, reducing misunderstandings.

🔍 Identifies Usability Issues Early Wireframes allow teams to test and refine user flows before investing in high-fidelity designs.

⏱ Saves Time and Resources By catching design flaws early, wireframing minimizes costly revisions during later stages of development.
